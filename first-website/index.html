        <p class="introduction">Hello World!</p>

        <p>Our lives seem to be marked by two repeating stages - action
            and reflection. In the process of action, we have yet to discover why things are happening, and what these events will lead to in the future. As the generosity of time grants us the opportunity to think deeper, we are able to sort out the pieces and put meaning behind them - reflection. Some devote themselves to the uninhibited pattern of action, while others dwell in the engrossing state of self reflection. Lingering too long in either stage can stunt the process of growth. To experience both is to learn. There wasn't a whole lot more that could be done. It had become a wait-and-see situation with the final results no longer in her control. That didn't stop her from trying to control the situation. She demanded that things be done as she desperately tried to control what couldn't be.</p>
