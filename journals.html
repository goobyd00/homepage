        <h3>My website is a shifting house:</h3>
        <p>Technological advancement does in fact coincide with artistic development. Even in the world of graphic design, technology plays a huge part in what limitations we have in terms of medium. If it weren’t for technological advancement, we wouldn’t have tools such as HTML, Adobe Creative Suite, etc. Some say that advanced tech such as artificial intelligence serves as a threat to art and design, while others see it as to tool.

        Websites can be subjective and objective; the process of coding serves as an architectural base that although can be customized, must follow a strict set of rules.

The emergence of digital technology and automation makes the use of the physical hand less common. Handmade qualities have become rare and sought after when products are now mass produced. This does not exclude web. </p>
